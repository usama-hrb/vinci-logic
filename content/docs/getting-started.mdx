# Getting Started with Vinci SOC Platform

Welcome to Vinci, a comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) platform designed to help organizations detect, respond to, and mitigate security threats in real-time.

## What is Vinci?

Vinci is a next-generation SOC platform that combines advanced threat detection, automated incident response, and comprehensive security analytics into a single, unified solution. Built for modern security teams, Vinci provides:

- **Real-time threat detection** across your entire infrastructure
- **Automated incident response** workflows to reduce MTTR
- **Advanced analytics** powered by machine learning
- **Seamless integrations** with existing security tools
- **Compliance reporting** for major frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Docker and Docker Compose
- At least 8GB of RAM
- PostgreSQL 14+ or compatible database
- Redis 6+ for caching and job queues

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/vinci-soc.git
cd vinci-soc

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Configure your database connection
nano .env

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Start the platform
npm run dev
```

### Initial Configuration

1. **Access the Dashboard**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. **Create Admin Account**: Follow the setup wizard to create your first admin user
3. **Connect Data Sources**: Configure your first data source (SIEM, firewall, or cloud provider)
4. **Set Up Alerts**: Define your first detection rules and alert thresholds

## Core Concepts

### Data Sources

Data sources are the foundation of your SOC platform. They collect security events from:

- Network devices (firewalls, IDS/IPS)
- Endpoint protection platforms
- Cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Application logs and APIs
- SIEM systems

### Detection Rules

Detection rules define the conditions that trigger security alerts. Vinci supports:

- **Signature-based detection**: Pattern matching against known threats
- **Anomaly detection**: ML-powered identification of unusual behavior
- **Correlation rules**: Multi-event patterns that indicate complex attacks
- **Threat intelligence**: Integration with threat feeds and IOC databases

### Incidents

When a detection rule triggers, Vinci creates an incident that includes:

- Alert details and severity level
- Affected assets and users
- Timeline of related events
- Recommended response actions
- Case management workflow

### Playbooks

Automated response playbooks help your team respond faster by:

- Orchestrating actions across multiple tools
- Enriching alerts with additional context
- Automating containment actions
- Documenting investigation steps
